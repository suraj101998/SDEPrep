Serverless Deployment Pattern:
In a serverless deployment, microservices are deployed as serverless functions, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.
The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, automatically handling the execution, scaling, and resource allocation.
This pattern is particularly useful for event-driven applications, where functions are triggered by events.
It simplifies deployment and reduces operational overhead, but may come with limitations on execution time and resource usage.
