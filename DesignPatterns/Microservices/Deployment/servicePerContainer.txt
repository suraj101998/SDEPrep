Service Instance per Container Pattern:
Each microservice instance is deployed in its own container.
Containers provide a lightweight and efficient way to encapsulate a microservice along with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.
This pattern leverages container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of containers, making it easier to maintain and scale microservices.
