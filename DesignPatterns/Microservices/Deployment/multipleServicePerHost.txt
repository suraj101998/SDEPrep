Multiple Service Instances per Host Pattern:
This pattern involves deploying multiple instances of different microservices on a single host, whether it's a virtual machine or a physical server.
By sharing the same host, this pattern maximizes resource utilization, reducing the cost and overhead associated with running multiple separate hosts.
However, it requires careful resource management to ensure that the services do not compete for the same resources, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.
