Blue-Green Deployment Pattern:
This pattern involves maintaining two environments: 
Blue (current production) and Green (new version).
The new version of the microservice is deployed to the Green environment, while the Blue environment continues to serve live traffic.
Once the new version is tested and verified in the Green environment, traffic is switched from Blue to Green.
This pattern minimizes downtime and allows for quick rollback if issues are encountered in the new version.
