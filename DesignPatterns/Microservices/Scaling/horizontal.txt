Horizontal Scaling Pattern:
Horizontal scaling, or "scaling out," involves adding more instances of a microservice to distribute the load.
This pattern improves the system's ability to handle increased traffic and provides better fault tolerance.
Instances can be added or removed dynamically based on the current load, which is particularly effective in cloud environments where resources can be provisioned on demand.
