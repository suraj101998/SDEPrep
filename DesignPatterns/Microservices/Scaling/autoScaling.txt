Auto-Scaling Pattern:
Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of microservice instances based on predefined metrics and thresholds, such as CPU usage, memory usage, or request rate.
This pattern ensures that the system can handle varying loads efficiently, scaling out during peak times and scaling in during low-demand periods.
Auto-scaling helps in optimizing resource usage and cost, maintaining performance without manual intervention.
