Service Mesh Pattern:
A service mesh provides a dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication.
It includes features such as load balancing, traffic management, service discovery, and security policies.
A service mesh abstracts the communication logic out of the microservices, enabling better observability, resilience, and control over how services interact.
It is particularly useful in complex microservices architectures, ensuring consistent and secure communication between services.
