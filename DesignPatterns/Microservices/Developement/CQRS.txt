6. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern
CQRS separates the read and write operations of a data store. 
Commands (write operations) update the state, while queries (read operations) fetch data from a different model optimized for reads.

An online retail application where the product catalog requires frequent updates and fast queries. 
Using CQRS, the write model ensures consistency when updating product information, while the read model provides quick responses for customer queries.
