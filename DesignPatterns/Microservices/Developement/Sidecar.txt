The Sidecar pattern deploys helper components (sidecars) alongside the main microservices. 
These sidecars handle cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring, and configuration management, allowing the main services to focus on business logic.

An application running in a Kubernetes cluster, where each microservice is accompanied by a sidecar for logging and monitoring. 
This pattern centralizes these concerns and simplifies the main serviceâ€™s codebase.
