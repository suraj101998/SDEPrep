9. Bulkhead Pattern
Bulkhead isolates different parts of a system to prevent failure in one component from affecting others. 
Each service or group of services operates in its own "compartment," like bulkheads in a ship.

A streaming service with different microservices for user management, video playback, and recommendations. 
Using bulkheads ensures that a failure in the recommendation service doesnâ€™t impact video playback or user management, maintaining overall system stability.
