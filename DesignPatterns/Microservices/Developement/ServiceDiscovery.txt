4. Service Discovery Pattern
Service Discovery allows microservices to find and communicate with each other dynamically. 
It involves a service registry where services register themselves and look up other services.

A microservices-based application deployed in a cloud environment where instances of services start and stop frequently. 
Service discovery ensures that services can locate each other without manual configuration, enabling automatic scaling and resilience.
