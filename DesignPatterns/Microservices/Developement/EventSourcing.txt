5. Event Sourcing Pattern
This pattern captures changes to an application state as a sequence of events. 
Instead of storing just the current state, it stores the state changes (events), allowing the system to reconstruct past states and audit trails.

A financial application managing transactions and accounts. 
By using event sourcing, the system can reconstruct account histories, track every transaction, and provide audit trails for regulatory compliance.
