1. API Gateway Pattern
An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all clients, 
routing requests to the appropriate microservices. 
It can handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, rate limiting, and load balancing.

A large e-commerce platform where multiple clients (web, mobile, third-party) 
need to interact with various services (catalog, user management, orders). 
The API Gateway simplifies client communication by providing a unified interface and handling complexities like security and routing.
