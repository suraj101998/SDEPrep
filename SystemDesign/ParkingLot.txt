4. Implementation

4.1 ParkingLot Class
class ParkingLot {
    private String id;
    private String address;
    private List<ParkingSpot> spots;
    
    public ParkingSpot findAvailableSpot(VehicleType type) {
        for (ParkingSpot spot : spots) {
            if (!spot.isOccupied() && spot.getType() == type) {
                return spot;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}

4.2 ParkingSpot Class
class ParkingSpot {
    private String spotId;
    private VehicleType type;
    private boolean isOccupied;
    
    public void occupySpot() { isOccupied = true; }
    public void freeSpot() { isOccupied = false; }
}

4.3 Vehicle Class
class Vehicle {
    private String licensePlate;
    private VehicleType type;
}

4.4 Ticketing System
class ParkingTicket {
    private String ticketId;
    private LocalDateTime entryTime;
    private LocalDateTime exitTime;
    private double amount;
}

4.5 Payment System
class Payment {
    public double calculateFees(ParkingTicket ticket) {
        Duration duration = Duration.between(ticket.getEntryTime(), ticket.getExitTime());
        return duration.toHours() * 10.0; // Example: $10 per hour
    }
}

5. Workflow for Each Function

5.1 Vehicle Entry
Vehicle enters the lot.
System checks for an available parking spot.
If found, generate a ticket and mark the spot as occupied.
User receives a ticket and proceeds to park.

5.2 Vehicle Exit & Payment
Vehicle arrives at the exit gate.
System calculates parking fees based on time spent.
User makes payment via cash/card/digital payment.
Spot is marked as available.

6. Scaling Considerations
Distributed Database: To handle millions of users.
Load Balancing: AWS Load Balancer for handling high traffic.
Caching: Redis for storing frequently accessed data.
Microservices Architecture: Independent services for parking, payments, and security.

7. Security Considerations
Access Control: Role-based access for admin and users.
Encryption: Secure payment transactions.
Fraud Prevention: Detecting unauthorized vehicle entry.

8. Failure Handling & Fault Tolerance
Retry Mechanism: For failed transactions.
Backup Database: Ensuring data persistence.
Circuit Breaker: Handling system failures gracefully.

9. Conclusion
This LLD ensures efficient parking lot management with real-time tracking, secure payments, and scalability. 
The system follows best practices in design, fault tolerance, and user experience.
