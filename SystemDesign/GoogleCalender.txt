1. Core Requirements
Functional Requirements:
Users should be able to create, update, delete, and view events.

Events should have details like title, date, time, duration, location, participants, and description.

Users can invite participants to events.

Users should receive reminders/notifications for upcoming events.

Events should support recurring schedules (daily, weekly, monthly).

Users should be able to share their calendars with others (public/private access).

Integration with third-party applications (e.g., Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams).

Support for multiple time zones.

Non-Functional Requirements:
High availability: Users should always be able to access their events.

Scalability: Millions of users should be able to store and retrieve events efficiently.

Low latency: Quick response times when fetching calendar events.

Data consistency: Event updates should be reflected in real-time.

Security & Privacy: Users' private events should not be accessible by unauthorized users.

2. System Components
User Service: Manages user authentication and profile.

Calendar Service: Stores and retrieves calendars for users.

Event Service: Handles CRUD operations for events.

Notification Service: Sends reminders via email, SMS, or push notifications.

Sharing & Permission Service: Controls who can view or edit a calendar.

Synchronization Service: Syncs events across devices and third-party apps.

Search & Recommendation Service: Allows searching for events and suggesting available time slots.

  "message": "Event created successfully"
}

Get Events for a User
Request (GET /users/{user_id}/events)
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "date": "2025-04-01"
}

Response
[
  {
    "event_id": 101,
    "title": "Project Meeting",

Technology Stack
Backend: Java (Spring Boot), Node.js
Database: PostgreSQL (for relational data), Redis (for caching), ElasticSearch (for search)
Messaging Queue: Kafka (for event-driven updates)
Storage: AWS S3 (for attachments)
Frontend: React.js, Angular

6. Scaling Considerations
Read Optimization
Use Redis caching for frequently accessed events.
Implement sharding in databases based on user ID.

Write Optimization
Use message queues (Kafka) for async event processing (e.g., sending notifications).
Implement batch updates for recurring events.

Load Balancing
Deploy API servers behind a load balancer.
Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse.

High Availability
Deploy services across multiple data centers.
Use leader-follower replication for the database.

7. Failure Handling & Security
Data Backup & Recovery: Regular database backups.
Rate Limiting: Prevent API abuse by limiting request frequency.
Access Control: Only authorized users can modify calendars.
Audit Logs: Maintain logs for event modifications.
Encryption: Secure user data using TLS & database encryption.

8. Conclusion
This Google Calendar-like system allows users to create, manage, and share events efficiently. 
It uses a microservices architecture for scalability and event-driven mechanisms for real-time notifications.
