4. Java Implementation
User Class
class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private Location currentLocation;

    public User(String userId, String name, Location location) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.name = name;
        this.currentLocation = location;
    }

    public Location getCurrentLocation() {
        return currentLocation;
    }

    public void updateLocation(Location newLocation) {
        this.currentLocation = newLocation;
    }
}

Location Class
class Location {
    private double latitude;
    private double longitude;
    private String placeName;

    public Location(double lat, double lon, String placeName) {
        this.latitude = lat;
        this.longitude = lon;
        this.placeName = placeName;
    }

    public double getLatitude() { return latitude; }
    public double getLongitude() { return longitude; }
}

Route Class
class Route {
    private Location start;
    private Location end;
    private List<Location> waypoints;
    private double estimatedTime;

    public Route(Location start, Location end, List<Location> waypoints, double estimatedTime) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
        this.waypoints = waypoints;
        this.estimatedTime = estimatedTime;
    }

    public double getEstimatedTime() { return estimatedTime; }
}

Navigation Service
class NavigationService {
    public Route getRoute(Location start, Location end) {
        // Logic to calculate route using map APIs
        List<Location> waypoints = new ArrayList<>();
        double estimatedTime = 20.5; // Example value
        return new Route(start, end, waypoints, estimatedTime);
    }
}

Traffic Service
class TrafficService {
    public String getTrafficStatus(Location location) {
        // Logic to fetch real-time traffic data
        return "Moderate Traffic"; // Example response
    }
}

Map Service
class MapService {
    private List<Location> locationsDatabase;

    public MapService() {
        locationsDatabase = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public Location searchLocation(String placeName) {
        for (Location loc : locationsDatabase) {
            if (loc.getPlaceName().equalsIgnoreCase(placeName)) {
                return loc;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}

Review Service
class ReviewService {
    private Map<String, List<String>> reviews = new HashMap<>();

    public void addReview(String placeName, String review) {
        reviews.computeIfAbsent(placeName, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(review);
    }

    public List<String> getReviews(String placeName) {
        return reviews.getOrDefault(placeName, new ArrayList<>());
    }
}

5. Workflow
Search for a Location
User enters a search query.
MapService.searchLocation() fetches the matching location.
Location details and nearby landmarks are displayed.

Get Directions
User enters the source and destination.
NavigationService.getRoute() calculates the best route.
Traffic conditions are retrieved from TrafficService.getTrafficStatus().
Directions are displayed with estimated arrival time.

Traffic Updates
User checks live traffic for a location.
TrafficService.getTrafficStatus() fetches data from external sources.
The UI displays real-time congestion levels.

6. Scaling Considerations
Microservices Architecture – Separate services for location, navigation, traffic, and reviews.
Geo-Spatial Indexing – Use QuadTree or R-Tree for fast location searches.
Database Partitioning – Shard data by regions (continent/country-wise).
Caching – Redis for frequently searched places.
Load Balancing – Distribute API requests across multiple servers.

7. Security Considerations
User Privacy – Encrypt and anonymize location data.
Secure APIs – Use OAuth and API keys for external integrations.
DDoS Protection – Rate limiting and CAPTCHAs for high-traffic endpoints.

8. Failure Handling & Fault Tolerance
Retry Mechanism – Auto-retry for failed API calls.
Circuit Breaker Pattern – Prevents overload on critical services.
Data Replication – Redundant storage for location and navigation data.

9. Conclusion
This Google Maps LLD ensures:
✅ Scalability (Supports millions of users).
✅ Efficiency (Fast location searches and navigation).
✅ Security (User privacy and secure APIs).
