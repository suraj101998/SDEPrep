1. Core Requirements

Functional Requirements:
User Registration & Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Contacts Management: Users can add, block, and manage contacts.
Messaging: Users can send and receive text messages.
Media Sharing: Users can share images, videos, and documents.
Voice & Video Calls: Users can initiate and receive calls.
Group Chats: Users can create and manage group conversations.
Message Reactions: Users can react to messages with emojis.
Message Deletion: Users can delete sent messages.
Status Updates: Users can share status updates with contacts.
End-to-End Encryption: Secure messaging with encryption.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability: System should handle millions of concurrent users.
Security: Secure authentication, message encryption, and data protection.
Fault Tolerance: Ensure reliability in case of server failures.
Low Latency: Instant message delivery and call connections.
Availability: 99.99% uptime to support global users.

2. System Components and Classes
2.1 Key Classes
User: Represents an individual user.
Contact: Stores a user's contact list.
Message: Represents a text or media message.
Chat: Stores chat conversations.
Group: Represents a group chat.
Call: Handles voice and video calls.
Status: Represents user status updates.
NotificationService: Sends message and call notifications.
EncryptionService: Ensures secure communication.

4. Implementation

4.1 User Class
class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private String phone;
    private List<Contact> contacts;
}

4.2 Message Class
class Message {
    private String messageId;
    private String senderId;
    private String receiverId;
    private String content;
    private LocalDateTime timestamp;
}

4.3 Chat Service
class ChatService {
    private Map<String, List<Message>> chatStore = new HashMap<>();

    public void sendMessage(String senderId, String receiverId, String content) {
        Message message = new Message(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), senderId, receiverId, content, LocalDateTime.now());
        chatStore.computeIfAbsent(receiverId, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(message);
        NotificationService.sendNotification(receiverId, "New message received.");
    }

    public List<Message> getMessages(String userId) {
        return chatStore.getOrDefault(userId, new ArrayList<>());
    }
}

4.4 Call Service
class CallService {
    public void initiateCall(String callerId, String receiverId, CallType type) {
        System.out.println("Call initiated from " + callerId + " to " + receiverId + " [" + type + "]");
    }
}

5. Workflow for Each Function
5.1 Messaging
User selects a contact and types a message.
ChatService.sendMessage() stores and delivers the message.
Recipient gets a notification.

5.2 Voice & Video Calling
User selects a contact and initiates a call.
CallService.initiateCall() starts the call session.
Receiver accepts or declines the call.

5.3 Message Deletion
User selects a message to delete.
ChatService.deleteMessage() removes the message from storage.
The deleted message is no longer visible to other users.

6. Scaling Considerations
Microservices Architecture: Separate services for messaging, calls, groups, and notifications.
Database Sharding: Partitioning user and message data for scalability.
Caching: Redis for frequently accessed data like recent chats.
Load Balancing: AWS ALB or Nginx to distribute traffic.
Event-Driven Processing: Kafka for handling high-throughput messages.

7. Security Considerations
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 + JWT for secure user sessions.
Data Encryption: End-to-end encryption for messages.
Spam Prevention: AI-based filtering for spam messages.
Secure Calls: Secure RTP for encrypted voice and video calls.

8. Failure Handling & Fault Tolerance
Retry Mechanism: Automatic retries for failed message deliveries.
Database Replication: Ensuring data availability across multiple regions.
Message Queues: Kafka to handle asynchronous messaging.
Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevent cascading failures in microservices.

9. Conclusion
This design ensures efficient messaging, contact management, media sharing, calls, and security features.
It follows scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-availability principles.
