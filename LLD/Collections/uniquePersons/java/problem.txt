Problem Statement
You are given a class Person which stores the data of each person. The Person class has two variables, name and age. Now you are given a list of Person and you need to remove the duplicates from the given list and return the filtered list.

You need to remove the duplicates based on name only, irrespective of the age. If two or more persons have the same name but different ages, then include the person who came first in the list and discard others.

Instructions
Implement the removeDuplicatePersons method inside the PersonManager class.
Return a List<Person> as the output after removing the duplicates based on name.
Only consider the name for checking duplicates.
If two or more person have same name but different age, then consider the one who came first in the input list.
You don't need to implement the Person class. It is already implemented.

There can be null and empty list in input. Handle that case and return empty List<Person> in that case.
