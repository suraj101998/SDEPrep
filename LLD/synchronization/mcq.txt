1. Which of the following statements is true about the synchronized keyword?- It can be applied to both instance methods and static methods
2. Which of the following is true regarding the differences between Hashtable and ConcurrentHashMap in Java?- ConcurrentHashMap allows multiple threads to access different parts of the map at the same time, while Hashtable does not.
3. What is the name of the algorithm used by Atomic Data types for thread-safety?- Compare and Swap
4. Consider the following code
    public class A {
    synchronized static void fun1(){
    }
    synchronized  void fun2(){
    }
    void fun3(){
    }
    }
    And the following code
    public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A obj1 = new A();
        A obj2 = new A();
    }
    }
    Which of the following canâ€™t execute concurrently on two separate threads? - obj1.fun1 and obj2.fun1

5. Which of the following statements about synchronization differences between Hashtable and HashMap, and StringBuilder and StringBuffer is true?- Hashtable is thread-safe because its methods are synchronized, while HashMap is not thread-safe by default.
6. Consider the following code:
    public class A {
        synchronized void fun1(){

        }
        synchronized  void fun2(){

        }
        void fun3(){

        }
    }
    And the following code:
    public class Client {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            A obj1 = new A();
            A obj2 = new A();

        }
    }
    Which of the following can execute concurrently on two separate threads? - B = obj1.fun1 and obj2.fun1 , C = obj2.fun2 and obj2.fun3

7. Which of the following statements about mutex locks in Java is true?- Mutex locks are used to protect critical sections of code from concurrent access.
