Vehicle Renting (Assignment)
Problem Statement
You are tasked with implementing a vehicle rental system that allows customers to rent cars and bicycles. You need to create classes for cars and bicycles, ensuring they implement a common interface for rental operations.

Class Structure:
Rentable Interface: This interface represents objects that can be rented. It should declare the following methods:

rent(): To rent the item.
returnItem(): To return the item.
Car Class: This class represents a car available for rental. It should implement the Rentable interface and include the following properties and methods:

Properties (public access modifiers):
carModel: representing the model of the car.
public isRented: a boolean indicating whether the car is currently rented.
Methods:
public rent(): Overrides the method to rent the car. It should set the isRented to true if the car is not already rented and print “car is now rented”.
public returnItem(): Overrides the method to return the car. It should set the isRented to false if the car is already rented and print “car is now returned”.
Bicycle Class: This class represents a bicycle available for rental. It should also implement the Rentable interface and include the following properties and methods:

Properties (public access modifiers):
bicycleModel: representing the model of the bicycle.
public isRented: a boolean indicating whether the bicycle is currently rented.
Methods:
public rent(): Overrides the method to rent the bicycle. It should set the isRented to true if the car is not already rented and print “cycle is now rented”.
public returnItem(): Overrides the method to return the bicycle. It should set the isRented to false if the cycle is already rented and print “cycle is now returned”.
Your Task:
Write Java code to implement the above problem statement, ensuring that the Car and Bicycle classes implement the Rentable interface and utilize public access modifiers for all class variables.
