1. Which of the following methods in a Semaphore is a blocking method?- acquire
2. Consider the following two statements: 
    a. If the value of Semaphore is > 0, Acquire method of Semaphores reduces the number of threads 
        allowed in critical section by 1, but allows the thread to enter the critical section 
    b. If the value of Semaphore is 0, Acquire method of Semaphores blocks the thread
    
    Which of the following is true? - Both 1 and 2 are true
3. Which of the following is true about the critical section of a correctly 
    working producer-consumer problem?- Critical Section of producer should begin with acquire on producer semaphore and end with release on consumer semaphore

4. Which of the following statements is true regarding mutex locks and semaphores?- Mutex Locks allow only 1 thread in critical section while Semaphores can allow multiple threads in the critical section at same time
5. Which of the following is true about semaphores, mutex locks, synchronized methods and Concurrent DS?- Semaphores can be used to solve adder-subtractor problem as well as producer-consumer problem
6. Consider the following two statements:
    Release method of Semaphores increases the number of threads allowed in the critical section by 1.
    If the value of Semaphore is 0, Release method of Semaphores blocks the thread
    Which of the following is true?- Only 1 is true
