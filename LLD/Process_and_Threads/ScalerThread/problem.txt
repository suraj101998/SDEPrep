**Raw Problem**
Write code to achieve the following
A class Client with main method that prints: I am the main class
Client class should create a new thread and invoke code in a class called Adder.
The Adder class should print: I am the Adder class
Client class should create a new thread and invoke code in a class called Subtractor.
The Subtractor class should print: I am the Subtractor class

Important Note - Use the ScalerThread class to create new threads. This is necessary for testing your code.
