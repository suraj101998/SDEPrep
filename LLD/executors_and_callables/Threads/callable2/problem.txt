Write code to achieve the following
A class Node to represent the Node of a BinaryTree.
Node should have two properties - left and right of type Node.
Node should also have an integer property - data.
Create a class TreeSizeCalculator to calculate the size of a BinaryTree using multiple threads.
TreeSizeCalculator constructor will be passed the root of the tree and ExecutorService to make new threads.
