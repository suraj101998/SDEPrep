Authors table with fields: AuthorID, FirstName, LastName and DOB.
Books table with fields: BookID, Title, PublicationDate and AuthorID.

1. Which attribute is the primary key in the Authors table? - AuthorID
2. In the Books table, what role does the AuthorID play? - It serves as the foreign key linking to the Authors table.
3. If we try to delete a record from the Authors table where the AuthorID matches with AuthorID in the Books table, what will happen? - The deletion will be rejected.
4. In the context of relational databases, what is the primary function of a primary key? - To uniquely identify each record in a table
5. Which of the following statements about foreign keys is true? - A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key or a unique key in another table.


Consider three tables in a database:
Student table with fields: StudentID (primary key), FirstName, LastName and DOB
Courses table with fields: CourseID (primary key), CourseName and CreditHours
Enrollment table with fields: EnrollmentID (primary key), StudentID, CourseID and EnrollmentDate

6. In the Enrollment table, which specific field serves as a foreign key and establishes a relationship with another table by referencing its primary key?
 - StudentID and CourseID

Orders(OrderID, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, ShipperID)

7. If the OrderID is a primary key, which of the following is true? - OrderID must be unique and not null.
8. If both OrderID and CustomerID together can be used to uniquely identify a record in the Orders table, this combination of keys is known as: - Composite Key

Employees table has fields: EmpID (primary key), FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, DOB and Address.

9. Is it possible for two employees to share the same Email in the Employees table, if Email is a candidate key? - NO
10. If there is another table Payroll with a field EmpID which refers to EmpID in Employees, what kind of key is EmpID in the Payroll table? - Foreign Key

Consider the following scenario
Students Table {id, student_name, branch_id}
Branch Table {branch_id, branch_name}

11. If a foreign key is set with the ON DELETE CASCADE option, what happens when a branch with branch_id 10 is deleted from the "Branch" table?- All Students with branch_id 10 will be deleted from the "Students" table.
12. If a foreign key is set with the ON UPDATE SET NULL option, what happens when a branch with branch_id 13 is updated from the “Branch” table?- All Students with branchid 13 will have their branchid set to NULL.
13. What is the default action taken by the MySQL database when a foreign key is defined without any explicit ON DELETE or ON UPDATE options? - The update or deletion of the department will not affect the "Students" table.
14. The ON DELETE SET DEFAULT option is only functional under which circumstances?- When the branchid of the "Branch" table is deleted, employees with matching branchid will be set to their default branch_id.

15. Consider the following statements regarding keys:

A super key is an attribute or combination of attributes that uniquely identifies records in an RDBMS table.
A candidate key is a subset of a super key.
All super keys are candidate keys but vice-versa is not true - 1 and 2 are true

16. In a 'Hospital' database, the 'Patients' table has attributes
{Patient_ID, Patient_Name, Date_Admitted}, and

the 'Doctors' table has attributes
{Doctor_ID, Doctor_Name, Specialty}.

To establish a relationship between the 'Patients' and 'Doctors' tables, which attribute could be used as a Foreign Key in the 'Patients' table?- {Doctor_ID}

17. In a 'Library Management' database, there are tables for 'Books,' 'Authors,' and 'Book_Authors.' The 'Books' table has attributes {Book_ID, Title, Genre}, the 'Authors' table has attributes {Author_ID, Author_Name, Nationality}, and the 'Book_Authors' table has attributes {Book_ID, Author_ID}.
Define a Composite Primary Key for the 'Book_Authors' table that maintains the relationship between books and authors.- {BookID, AuthorID}

18. Consider an 'E-commerce' database with tables for 'Products,' 'Orders,' and 'Customers.' The 'Products' table has attributes {Product_ID, Product_Name, Price}, the 'Orders' table has attributes {Order_ID, Order_Date, Customer_ID}, and the 'Customers' table has attributes {Customer_ID, Customer_Name, Email}.
Design a Foreign Key in the 'Orders' table that establishes a connection between orders and products.- {Product_ID}

19. In a quaint town, there was a popular bookstore named "Readers' Haven." The store was known for its vast collection of books, and they decided to organize their inventory using a database management system.
Which of the following attributes is most likely to be used as a primary key in the "Books" table of the "Readers' Haven" bookstore database?- ISBN (International Standard Book Number)

20. In a quaint town, there was a popular bookstore named "Readers' Haven." The store was known for its vast collection of books, and they decided to organize their inventory using a database management system.

The bookstore manager wants to ensure that no two books in the "Books" table have the same ISBN. Which type of key constraint should be applied to the ISBN attribute?- PRIMARY KEY constraint
