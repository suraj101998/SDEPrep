10. what are the Differences Spring Framework Vs Spring Boot?
Key Differences:

Spring Framework	                    Spring Boot
Manual Configuration Required	        Auto-Configuration Enabled
No Embedded Server	                    Embedded Server (Tomcat/Jetty)
XML or Java Config Required	            No XML, Minimal Java Config
Complex Project Setup	                Easy Starter Templates (starters)
Used for Any Size App	                Best for Microservices & REST APIs

11. What annotations are used to create an Interceptor?
Interceptor is a prominent functionality of Spring Boot. It uses the annotated class @Component and implements the interface HandlerInterceptor.

The interface contains 3 main methods, which are:
The preHandle() Method − preHandle() is used to intercept the request before the handler's implementation. If preHandle() returns a “true” boolean value, developers can continue with handler execution. If preHandle() returns a “false” boolean value, developers should stop the handler execution. 
The postHandle() Method − postHandle() is used for intercepting a request following the handler's implementation. It allows the manipulation of the ModelAndView Object before users render it.
The afterCompletion() Method − A HandlerInterceptor callback approach, the afterCompletion() method is used when the entire request gets completed.

12. What is a Swagger in Spring Boot?
Swagger is used to detail and document RESTful APIs in a machine-readable and human-readable format that is easily understandable for testers, developers, and individuals with little knowledge of source code.

13. What are Profiles in Spring Boot?
Profiles in the Spring framework enable users to map components and beans to specific profiles, such as the Development (dev) profile, Production (prod) profile, or the Test profile. 
In Spring Boot, the annotation @Profile maps components and beans to a certain profile. 
Developers can also set up profiles using the SpringApplication, for instance, SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles("dev").

14. What differentiates Spring Data JPA and Hibernate?
A Java Persistence API (JPA) implementation, Hibernate facilitates Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), allowing users to store, retrieve, map, and update application data to and from Java objects and relational databases. Hibernate maps the data types in Java to SQL (Structured Query Language) data types and the classes in Java to the database tables, relieving developers from scripting data persistence SQL programs. 
On the other hand, a Spring Data sub-project, Spring Data JPA, abstracts the DAL (Data Access Layer) by applying JPA and Object–Relational Mapping implementations, such as Hibernate. Spring Data JPA facilitates the smooth implementation of JPA repositories and intends to improve the overall implementation of DAL greatly.

15. How are the @RestController and @Controller Annotation different?
The traditional Spring @Controller annotation specifies that an annotated class represents a controller. It’s a @Component specialization and autodetected via the classpath scanning. The @Controller annotation and the annotated handler methodologies are used based on @RequestMapping annotations.
Developers use the @RestController annotation to develop RESTful web services, utilizing the Spring Model–View–Controller (MVC). The Spring @RestController maps the request data using specified request handler methods. Once the handler method generates the response body, the @RestController modifies it to an XML or JSON response.

16. What is Dependency Injection in Spring Boot?
process of defining dependency, specifically through constructor arguments. Additionally, the dependencies here can also be set by the properties on the object instance once the construction is completed via the factory method. Dependency injection improves testability, promotes loose coupling, simplifies configuration and eases reusability.

17. How does Spring Boot handle externalized configuration?
The externalized configuration feature in Spring Boot allows users to use a single application code across different environments. This is achieved by separate configuration storage. Multiple ways can be used to achieve externalized configuration, such as configuration files, structured objects, property sources and injection, custom spring validator, environment abstraction, validation, and others. 

18. What is Spring Boot DevTools?
Spring Boot DevTools are tools that ease application development and optimization. These tools reduce development time and enhance productivity. They can auto-recompile the code without the requirement to restart the application manually. DevTools are also used for static resource caching, actuator endpoints, and automatic application restart. The ‘spring-boot-devtools’ module dependency can easily be added to the project.

19. What is the use of Spring Boot Actuator endpoints?
comprises built-in endpoints that monitor and interact with the application.
It exposes REST endpoints to:
Monitor Application Health
Check Metrics (Memory, CPU, DB, etc.)
View App Info
Monitor Traffic
Perform Health Checks
Trace Errors

Common Actuator endpoints
Endpoint                | Purpose                       | Example URL
/actuator/health        | Application health check      | http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
/actuator/info          | Application info              | http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
/actuator/metrics       | Performance metrics           | http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics
/actuator/env           | View environment variables    | http://localhost:8080/actuator/env
/actuator/beans         | View all Spring Beans         | http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans
/actuator/httptrace     | Last HTTP request details     | http://localhost:8080/actuator/httptrace

20. What is Spring Boot Starter?
Spring Boot Starter is a collection of dependency descriptors used to simplify the development process of Spring applications. It serves as the foundation for web applications, microservices and other Spring-based projects. It enhances the user’s productivity by directing the focus on writing rather than working on infrastructure handling. Spring Boot Starter also eases POM management and eliminates the requirement to remember dependency names and versions. 

21. What are the different scopes available in Spring Boot?
Singleton: It is the default scope where only a single instance is used for the complete application context. 
Prototype: Here, each request creates a new bean instance. 
Request: Every HTTP request creates a new bean instance.
Session: Each HTTP session creates a new bean instance. 
Application: The entire web application gets a new Bean instance.

22. How does Spring Boot support logging?
Sprint Boot supports logging to ease logging integration and configuration in the application. The default logging frameworks are Java Util Logging, Logback, and Log4j2. Further, Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) is used to switch logging frameworks. 

23. What is Spring Boot’s embedded server, and how do you configure it?
The feature of an embedded server in Spring Boot offers direct access to the web server within the application. It removes the need for separate server installation and configuration, easing the deployment process.
The different methods to configure the server are: 

Using application.properties or application.yml
Via programmatic configurations 
Through command-line agreements 

24. purpose of Spring Boot’s @Conditional annotations?
The @Conditional annotations create customizable and flexible configurations by applying specific settings or loading beans when certain conditions are met at runtime. These features contribute to easily managing different environments, optional dependencies and feature toggles. They can be directly used as a type-level annotation or indirectly annotated with @Component.

25. How does Spring Boot achieve auto-configuration?
The Spring Boot auto-configuration is achieved according to the jar dependencies the user adds. Spring Boot scans the classpath for configuration classes and specific libraries and automatically configures the beans based on them. The feature eliminates the manual configuration requirements.

26. What are Spring Boot filters, and how are they used?
The Spring Boot filters are powerful tools that positively influence the request-response lifecycle. They are the components of the servlet API that function at HTTP requests and responses. The filters serve the key aim of logging, authentication and input validation. They are also used for data transformation, caching, and security checks.

27. How do you secure a Spring Boot application?
The different ways to secure the Spring Boot application include:

Password encoder: It is the sprint security password management process component that encodes and decodes the password by default. 
HTTPS: It encrypts the data during the process of transmission. Enable TLS/SSL in application.properties to enable this protection. 
CSRF protection: Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks is enabled by default in Spring Security. 
Method level security: It is used when low privileged or unauthorized user access to sensitive functions is encountered. The @PreAuthorize annotation can be used here. 
Parameterized queries: It is used to protect against SQL injections. 
Rigorous input validation: The input's length, type, format and range must be validated. Built-in validation can be used here. 
Sensitive data encryption: It will be done by the @EncryptablePropertySource function.

28. what is bean destruction?
process of cleaning up resources or shutdown operations before a bean is removed from the Spring container.
Ways to Handle Bean Destruction in Spring:
1. Using @PreDestroy Annotation: marks a method to be called before the bean is destroyed.
2. Implementing DisposableBean Interface: Implement the destroy() method to define custom destruction logic.
3. Using destroyMethod in XML or @Bean: Specify the destroy method explicitly in configuration.
eg: @Bean(destroyMethod = "cleanup")

29. Define Bean lifecycle?
Bean Lifecycle Flow:

Bean is instantiated.
Dependencies are injected.
Initialization methods (@PostConstruct or InitializingBean) are called.
Bean is in use.
Destruction phase:
Calls methods annotated with @PreDestroy, destroy() from DisposableBean, or specified destroyMethod.

30. what is Fetch Type in JPA?

FetchType determines how related entities are loaded from the database. 
It defines whether associated entities should be fetched eagerly or lazily when querying the main entity.
two types of fetching strategies:
1. FetchType.EAGER : Related entities are loaded immediately with the parent entity.
use-case: When Associated entity is always needed. To avoid multiple queries (if small data).
Risk: lead to performance issues if many associations are fetched eagerly (N+1 problem).

2. FetchType.LAZY: Related entities are loaded on-demand (when accessed).
use-case: When Associated data is optional. To improve performance and avoid heavy joins.
Risk: Can cause LazyInitializationException.

31. What is @Async annotation?
used to execute a method asynchronously, i.e., in a separate thread, 
allowing the caller to continue execution without waiting for the method to complete.

Use Case: When you want to perform non-blocking operations, such as:
Sending emails
Logging
Calling external APIs
Background jobs

Setup Steps
1. Enable async support in your configuration class
2. Annotate your method with @Async: The method must not be private. Return type can be void, Future<T>, CompletableFuture<T>, etc.
3. Call the method from another Spring-managed bean

32. what is ApplicationContext ? 
central interface in Spring Framework for providing configuration information to the application.
Spring Boot automatically creates ApplicationContext on startup using @SpringBootApplication.
It is responsible for:
Bean Creation (Object Creation)
Dependency Injection (Auto Wiring)
Managing Bean Lifecycle
Providing Configuration Metadata
Event Handling

33. what is Idompodent method in rest?

if after performing an operation multiple times also has the same effect as performing it once.
eg: GET, PUT, DELETE. beacuse they all does the operation on the same data.

But POST is not Idompodent beacuse each time we do a post it creates a new record/resource in the DB.

34. Employee list of addresses validation. How will I do it?
public class EmployeeRequest {

    @NotBlank(message = "Employee name should not be blank")
    private String name;

    @Valid // Mandatory for List validation
    @NotEmpty(message = "Address list cannot be empty")
    private List<Address> addresses;

    // getters and setters
}

public class Address {

    @NotBlank(message = "Street should not be blank")
    private String street;

    @NotBlank(message = "City should not be blank")
    private String city;

    @Pattern(regexp = "\\d{6}", message = "Pincode must be 6 digits")
    private String pincode;

    // getters and setters
}

@PostMapping("/addEmployee")
public ResponseEntity<String> addEmployee(@Valid @RequestBody EmployeeRequest employeeRequest) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok("Employee Added Successfully");
}


35. how do we handle caching in spring boot?

1. Enable Caching
To use caching in Spring Boot, add this annotation on your main class or any @Configuration class

2. Use Caching in Your Service
Spring provides annotations like:
@Cacheable – Caches method return value
@CachePut – Updates cache without skipping the method execution
@CacheEvict – Removes entry from the cache

3. Default Cache Manager
By default, Spring uses SimpleCacheManager with a ConcurrentHashMap under the hood (in-memory cache). 
You can configure custom managers like Redis or EhCache.

36. Transactional annotations are based on what rules?

1. Transaction Propagation (Propagation Rules)
Defines how a transaction should behave when a method is called inside an existing transaction.

Common types:
Propagation Type	            Description
REQUIRED (default)	            Join current transaction or create new if none exists.
REQUIRES_NEW	                Always create a new transaction, suspending the current one.
NESTED	                        Execute within a nested transaction if supported.
SUPPORTS	                    Join if a transaction exists, else execute non-transactionally.
NOT_SUPPORTED	                Always execute non-transactionally, suspending any transaction.
NEVER	                        Fails if a transaction exists.
MANDATORY	                    Requires an existing transaction, fails if none.

2. Rollback Rules
By default, Spring only rolls back on unchecked exceptions (subclasses of RuntimeException or Error).
eg: @Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)

3. Read-Only Transactions
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
Optimizes queries for read operations.
Some databases use this hint to skip locking or flushing.

4. Isolation Levels
Controls how data is visible during concurrent transactions.
types:
DEFAULT: Use the DB's default.

READ_UNCOMMITTED: Dirty reads possible: You can read data not yet committed by other transactions.
Fastest, but least safe. Not commonly used. eg: T1 updates a row, but hasn’t committed. 
T2 reads that dirty value.

READ_COMMITTED: No dirty reads: Only sees committed data.
Non-repeatable reads can happen: Same query in the same transaction may return different results.
eg: T1 reads a row. T2 updates and commits the row. 
If T1 reads again, it sees a different value.

REPEATABLE_READ: Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
Phantom reads may happen: A new row added by another transaction may appear in the same query. 
eg: T1 reads all rows with status = 'ACTIVE'. 
T2 inserts a new status = 'ACTIVE' and commits. T1 re-executes the same query and sees more rows.

SERIALIZABLE: Transactions are executed as if serially one after another. 
Prevents all issues: dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads. 
Slower, may lead to more locking and blocking.
