1. Tell the React Life Cycle?

Phases of React Lifecycle:

# Mounting Phase: The component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
# Updating Phase:  The component's state or props have changed, causing a re-render.
# Unmounting Phase: The component is being removed from the DOM.
# Error Handling Phase: If an error occurs during rendering, in lifecycle methods, or in the constructors of any child components, this method can catch the error.

2. what are hooks in react ? Mention some hooks?

Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and 
lifecycle features without writing a class.

useState:	Manages component state
useEffect:	Handles side effects
useContext:	Accesses global state
useRef:	Works with DOM elements & persists values
useReducer:	Manages complex state logic
useCallback:	Memoizes functions to prevent re-creation
useMemo:	Memoizes expensive calculations
useLayoutEffect:	Similar to useEffect, but runs synchronously after DOM updates
useImperativeHandle:	Customizes ref behavior when using forwardRef
