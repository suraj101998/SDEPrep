Problem Recap:
You're allowed to move any character to the end of the string. 
You want to transform a string into its reverse using the minimum number of such operations.

Key Insight:
If you're allowed to move any character to the end, then:

The minimum operations required to convert image to reverse(image) is:
length of image - length of longest prefix of reverse(image) that matches any suffix of image in order.

But the trick is: the characters must match in order, not necessarily contiguous.
So Z-algorithm is not enough here â€” we must match in order but not necessarily continuously.


 * Approach (Greedy 2-Pointer Matching)
Idea:
Let image = S
Let reversed = reverse(S)

Use 2 pointers:
i for S
j for reversed
Move i through S, and whenever S[i] == reversed[j], increase j.
At the end, j will tell how many characters of the reversed string you matched in order.

Time & Space Complexity:
Time: O(N)
Space: O(N) (for reversed string, or O(1) if done with pointers)

            if (image.charAt(i) == reversed.charAt(j)) {
                j++;
            }
            i++;
        }

        return image.length() - j;
